\section{Introduction}

Propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) is the problem of determining whether a propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is satisfiable, i.e. if there exists a truth assignment of variables that satisfies the formula.
Such assignments are called models.
Propositional formulas can be thought of as finite sets of clauses, which in turn are finite sets of literals.
A literal is either a propositional variable or its negation.
Given a CNF formula, a model thus satisfies all its clauses, that is, it sets at least one literal in each clause to true.
Propositional model counting, \#SAT, is a related but harder problem of determining the amount of satisfying truth assignments of a CNF formula.

The complexity class P consists of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time; NP is a class of all problems the solutions of which can be verified in polynomial time. SAT is well known to be NP-complete.
The counting counterpart of NP is the class \#P.
\#SAT has been shown to be \#P-complete and remains \#P-hard even when syntactical restrictions on the input CNF formulas are introduced \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianS17}.
However, there has been research on structural restrictions \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianS17, DBLP:conf/sat/CapelliDM14, DBLP:conf/sat/GanianPSSS22, DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14, DBLP:journals/dam/FischerMR08, DBLP:journals/jda/SamerS10, DBLP:journals/fuin/GanianHO13} which lead to efficient algorithms for \#SAT.

Structural restrictions are defined according to a parameter on some graph associated with the problem instance.
In case of \#SAT, such graphs often describe the relationship between the variables and/or clauses of the formula.
A certain parameter $k$, usually a positive integer, is then determined for this graphic representation of a propositional formula. 
If it's then possible to show that for some fixed $k$, there exists an algorithm that can compute \#SAT in time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$, where $f$ is a computable function and $n$ is the size of the formula, we say that \#SAT is {\em fixed-parameter tractable} when parameterized by $k$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianS17}.
As one can see, for a fixed $k$ the term $f(k)$ is a constant, basically meaning that the runtime of the parameterized algorithm is polynomial for such $k$, and such algorithm can therefore be assumed efficient (tractable). The class of fixed parameter tractable problems is denoted FPT.
Its non-parameterized counterpart, FP, is the class of functional problems solvable in polynomial time.

This thesis is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we provide the necessary formal definitions, in particular with regards to graphical representations of formulas, and introduce several structural restrictions, among which are {\em treewidth}, {\em clique-width}, {\em disjoint branches}, {\em twin-width}, {\em rank-width}, {\em ps-width}, and others.

\section{Preliminaries}

We first introduce some notions from graph theory which will be useful in this thesis.
We will use these notions to represent propositional formulas, and then perform transformations on them to obtain the desired width parameters.
For examples, see Fig. \ref{fig:graphs}.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Graphs}.
A graph is a pair $G = (V,E)$ with a vertex set $V$ and an edge set $E$.
An edge $e=uv$ connects the vertex $u$ to $v$.
A graph is called {\em bipartite} if the vertices can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, and every edge has endpoints in both sets.
There are several commonly known graphs one can define for CNF formulas, such as {\em primal, dual} and {\em incidence graphs}.
In a primal graph, variables of the formula are the graph's vertices, and two vertices are connected by an edge iff both corresponding variables appear together in a clause.
A dual graph's vertices are its clauses, and two vertices are adjacent iff their corresponding clauses share a variable.
An incidence graph is a bipartite graph with variables and clauses both being vertices, and a variable is connected with a clause by an edge iff the variable appears in the clause.
A more recently studied graph is the {\em consensus graph}, where the vertices are the clauses of the formula, and two vertices are connected by an edge iff the clauses do not clash, that is, there exists no literal in one of the clauses that appears negated in the other clause.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Hypergraphs}.
A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and (hyper)edge set $E$ is a generalized notion of graphs, where edges may connect not only two, but any amount of vertices.
As such, an edge is a set of vertices it connects.
A CNF formula can be represented by a primal hypergraph, whose vertices are the formula's variables, and hyperedges are the clauses, i.e. hyperedges connect the variables that appear in the clause.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Trigraphs.}
A trigraph $G=(V,E,E')$ is a graph that distinguishes two classes of edges, $E$ and $E'$.
Often such two classes are positive and negative edges, denoted $E^+$ and $E^-$, respectively, in which case the trigraph is called a {\em signed graph}.
A {\em signed trigraph} distinguishes, apart from positive and negative edges, also one more class of edges.
With a CNF formula we associate a signed bipartite incidence graph, where the two classes of vertices are the formula's clauses and variables, and an edge connects a variable with the clause where it appears, with the appropriate sign (according to whether the variable occurs positively or negatively in the clause).

\subsection{Width Parameters}

We now proceed with an introduction of many parameters used to describe the structure of graphs, the so-called {\em width parameters}. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Treewidth} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianS17}.
For a simple, undirected, finite graph $G = (V,E)$ we define a {\em tree decomposition} to be a pair $(T, B)$, where $T$ is a tree, $B$ a set of {\em bags}, and the vertices of $T$ are the bags.
Each bag is a set of the graph's vertices.
Moreover, a tree decomposition has to fulfil the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for any edge $uv\in E$ there exists some bag $B' \in B$ such that $\{u,v\} \subseteq B'$, and
	\item for any vertex $v\in V$, $T[\{ b \in B \; | \; v \in b \}]$ is a connected tree with at least one node.
\end{enumerate}
Informally speaking, tree decompositions are a structured way to ``break down'' a graph into its parts.
We define the {\em width} of a tree decomposition to be its maximum bag size minus one, and the {\em treewidth} of $G$, $\textbf{tw}(G)$, to be the minimum width over all its tree decompositions.\\

\noindent 
\textbf{Disjoint branches} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/CapelliDM14}.
A join tree of a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is a pair $(\mathcal{T}, \lambda)$, where $\mathcal{T}=(N,T)$ is a tree with node set $N$ and edge set $T$, and $\lambda : N \rightarrow E$ is a bijection from tree's nodes to hypergraph's edges, which fulfils the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for every $e\in E$, there exists a $t\in N$ such that $\lambda(t)=e$, and
	\item for every $v\in V$, $\mathcal{T}[\{ n \in N \; | \; v \in \lambda(n) \}]$ is a connected subtree of $\mathcal{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
Notice how the definition is similar to that of tree decompositions.
A join tree where for every two nodes $n, n'$ on different branches, $\lambda(n) \cap \lambda(n') = \emptyset$, is called a {\em disjoint branches decomposition}. 
Such decompositions represent a way to ``break down'' a hypergraph into disjoint parts (recall that $\lambda(n)$ is a hypergraph's edge).

We now consider acyclicity of hypergraphs.
In contrast to graphs, there is not just one single but several notions of acyclicity for hypergraphs, such as $\alpha$- (most general), $\beta$- and $\gamma$-acyclicity (least general), all of which can be defined using join trees.

A hypergraph is said to be $\alpha$-acyclic if it has a join tree.
One shortcoming of this definition is that a subhypergraph of an $\alpha$-acyclic hypergraph is not necessarily $\alpha$-acyclic itself.
Thus, a more restrictive notion of $\beta$-acyclicity was introduced, which requires that a hypergraph and all its subhypergraphs be $\alpha$-acyclic.
Admitting a disjoint branches decomposition is itself another notion of hypergraph acyclicity, which lies strictly between $\beta$- and $\gamma$-acyclicity.
As such, having a disjoint branches decomposition implies $\beta$- and $\alpha$-acyclicity.
Finally, a hypergraph is $\gamma$-acyclic if it admits a disjoint branches decomposition for any choice of hyperedge as the root.

Using the four introduced notions of acyclicity, we define the respective classes of hypergraphs, i.e. $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\gamma$-acyclic hypergraphs, as well as hypergraphs that admit a disjoint branches decomposition. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Twin-width} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianPSSS22}.
Consider a trigraph $G=(V,E,R)$ that distinguishes between black ($E$) and red ($R$) edges.
A trigraph whose subgraph induced by the red edges, that is $G[R]$, has maximum degree at most $d$, is called a {\em d-trigraph}.

A {\em contraction} of a trigraph $G$ is a trigraph $G'=G/u,v$ that is a result of contracting two vertices $u,v \in V(G)$ into a single vertex $w$, where the edges of $w$ are determined according to the following:
\begin{itemize}[--]
	\item $wx \in E(G')$ iff $ux, vx \in E(G)$,
	\item $wx \not\in E(G') \cup R(G')$ iff $ux, vx \not\in E(G)\cup R(G),$
	\item $wx \in R(G')$ otherwise.
\end{itemize}
Intuitively, red edges represent ``errors'' that occur during a contraction.
A contraction of a $d$-trigraph is called {\em d-contraction} if it is a $d$-trigraph itself.
If there exists a sequence of $d$-contractions such that a graph is contracted into a single vertex, the graph is called {\em d-collapsible}.
The {\em twin-width} $\textbf{tww}(G)$ of a trigraph $G$ is then the minimal $d$ for which it is $d$-collapsible. \\

% NOTE! signed twin-width. Commented out, if necessary, repeat this in the main part of the thesis.
%
%
%For bipartite trigraphs it is helpful to restrict contraction sequences to those where only vertices from the same partition are contracted.
%That is, for a bipartite trigraph $G$ with $V(G) = A \cup B$, $A \cap B = \emptyset$, there is no contraction of the form $G/a,b$ in the sequence, where $a\in A, b\in B$.
%Such sequences are called {\em bipartite contraction sequences}.
%Notice that no bipartite contraction sequence can end in a single-vertex graph and therefore $d$-collapsibility does not apply.

%We introduce another definition.
%Say a bipartite trigraph $G$ is {\em bipartitely $d$-collapsible} if there exists a sequence of bipartite $d$-contractions such that $G$ is collapsed into a graph with two vertices.
%Then, the {\em signed twin-width} $\textbf{stww}(G)$ of a bipartite trigraph $G$ is the minimal $d$ for which it is bipartitely $d$-collapsible.
%In other words, it is the minimal red degree of all bipartite contraction sequences of $G$.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Clique-width} \cite{DBLP:journals/dam/FischerMR08}.
Colored graphs are graphs with vertices annotated by an integer (color) in $\{1,...,k\}$.
Consider the following set of operations on colored graphs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Disjoint union $\oplus$, where $V(A \oplus B)=\{ (v,\, \lambda(v)) \; | \; v \in V(A) \text{ or } v\in V(B) \}$, and $\lambda(v)=$ ``$A$'' if $v\in A$, and $\lambda(v)=$ ``$B$'' if $v\in B$,
	\item Recoloring $\rho_{i,j}(I)$, resulting in a graph where vertices colored $i$ are re-colored $j$,
	\item Edge creation:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item for unsigned graphs, $\mu_{i,j}(I)$ results in a graph where all vertices colored $i$ are adjacent to all vertices colored $j$,
		\item for signed graphs, $\mu_{i,j}^+(I)$ or $\mu_{i,j}^-(I)$ result in a graph where all vertices colored $i$ are connected to all vertices colored $j$ by a positive or negative edge, respectively. In case of bipartite graphs, vertices from different vertex partitions are not connected.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Notice that the disjoint union is used to introduce single-vertex graphs and avoid name conflicts between vertices.
In particular, $G \oplus G \neq G$.
As an example, consider how one can create cliques using two colors: beginning with two single-vertex graphs $A, B$ colored, say, red (1) and blue (2) respectively, a 2-clique can be obtained as $\mu_{1,2}(A \oplus B)$, a 3-clique as $\mu_{1,2}(\rho_{2,1}(\mu_{1,2}(A \oplus B)) \oplus B)$, and so on.

{\em Clique-width} $\textbf{cw}(G)$ is defined as the minimal $k$ such that $G$ can be obtained from colored single-vertex graphs using the operations above.
From the example above it is easy to see that cliques have clique-width at most 2.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Branch-width} \cite{DBLP:journals/tocl/LodhaOS19}.
A branch decomposition of a hypergraph $H$ is a pair $(T, \gamma)$ where $T$ is a tree and $\gamma$ is a bijection between the leaves of $T$ and hyperedges of $H$.
For a subset $L$ of leaves, $\gamma(L)$ denotes the set $\{ \gamma(v) \; | \; v \in L \}$, and for a subtree $T'$ of $T$, $\gamma(T')$ is defined as $\{ \gamma(v) \; | \; v  \text{ is a leaf of } T' \}$.

Any subset $E$ of hyperedges of $H$ defines a {\em separation} of $H$, that is the pair $(E,\, E(H) \setminus E)$.
A {\em load vertex} is a vertex that is incident to both an edge in $E$ and an edge in $E(H) \setminus E$.
For a hypergraph $H$ and subset $E$ of hyperedges, $\delta(E)$ is the set of such load vertices of $E$.
In a branch decomposition $(T, \gamma)$ of $H$, any edge $e$ of $T$ similarly defines a separation of the tree. 
We define $\delta(e)$ as the set of load vertices of $\gamma(T')$, that is $\delta(e) = \delta(\gamma(T'))$, where $T'$ is any of the two components in the forest $T \setminus \{e\}$.

The width of an edge $e$ of $T$ is then $|\delta(e)|$, and the width of a branch decomposition is the maximum width over all its edges.
The {\em branch-width} of hypergraph $H$ is the minimum width over all its branch decompositions. In case of $E(H) = \emptyset$, $H$ has no branch decompositions, and its branch-width is said to be 0. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Rank-width} \cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/GanianHO13}.
A set function $f$ maps a subset to a number, i.e. $f : 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, where $V$ is a finite set.
If for all $X,Y \subseteq V$ it holds that $f(X)+f(Y) \geq f(X\cap Y) + f(X\cup Y)$, $f$ is called {\em submodular}.
Moreover, if for all $X\subseteq V$, $f(X) = f(V \setminus X)$, $f$ is said to be {\em symmetric}.

A {\em branch decomposition} of a symmetric, submodular function $f$ is a pair $(T, \lambda)$, where $T$ is a subcubic tree (i.e., every vertex is incident with at most three edges), and $\lambda$ a bijective function from $V$ to the leaves of $T$.
If $\lambda$ is surjective, the branch decomposition is said to be {\em partial}.

For a (partial) branch decomposition $\mathcal{T} = (T,\lambda)$ of $f$ and some edge $e$, $T \setminus e$ is a forest that consists of two connected subtrees of $T$.
Thus $e$ defines a partition $(X,Y)$ of the leaves of the branch decomposition.
The width of the edge $e$ is defined as $f(\lambda^{-1}(X)) = f(\lambda^{-1}(Y))$, and the width of a branch decomposition as the maximum width of all edges of $T$.
Then, the {\em branch-width} of a symmetric, submodular function $f$ is the minimum width over all its branch decompositions.

Consider a simple graph $G$, subsets $X,Y \subseteq V(G)$ and let $\mathbf{A}_G[X,Y]$ be a binary matrix.
The entry $a_{x,y}$ of $\mathbf{A}_G[X,Y]$ is 1 iff $xy \in E(G)$, where $x\in X$, and $y\in Y$.

A {\em cut-rank function} is a symmetric, submodular function $\rho_G : 2^{V(G)} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\rho_G(X)=\rho_G(V(G)\setminus X) = \text{rank}(\mathbf{A}_G[X, V(G)\setminus X])$.
A {\em rank decomposition} is the branch decomposition of $\rho_G$.
Then, {\em rank-width} $\textbf{rw}(G)$ is the branch-width of $\rho_G$. \\


\noindent
\textbf{ps-width} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14}.
ps-width, in contrast to most width parameters introduced above, is defined specifically for propositional formulas.
For a propositional formula $F$, let $\text{var}(F)$ denote the set of variables of $F$, and $\text{cla}(F)$ the set of its clauses.
For a set $C \subseteq \text{cla}(F)$, we say $C$ is {\em precisely satisfiable} in $F$ if there exists some assignment $\tau$ such that $\tau(c)=1$ for all $c\in C$, and $\tau(c)=0$ for all $c \in \text{cla}(F)\setminus C$.
By $\mathcal{PS}(F)$ we denote the set of all sets $C$ such that $C \subseteq \text{cla}(F)$ and $C$ is precisely satisfiable.


A {\em branch decomposition} of a formula $F$ is a pair $(T, \delta)$, where $T$ is a rooted binary tree, and $\delta$ a bijection from the leaves of $T$ to $\text{var}(F) \cup \text{cla}(F)$.
For an internal (non-leaf) node $v$ of $T$, let $\delta(v) = \{ \delta(l) \; | \; l \text{ is a leaf of subtree rooted in } v \}$.
For any node $v$ of $T$, $\delta(v)$ describes certain cuts of the propositional formula.
Let $F_v$ be then a formula induced by the clauses in cla$(F)\setminus \delta(v)$ and variables in $\delta(v)$, and $F_{\overline{v}}$ a formula induced by the clauses in $\delta(v)$ and the variables in var$(F)\setminus \delta(v)$.

{\em ps-value} ps$(\delta(v))$ of a cut $\delta(v)$ is defined as max$\{|\mathcal{PS}(F_v)|, |\mathcal{PS}(F_{\overline{v}})|\}$, and the {\em ps-width} of a branch decomposition $(T,\delta)$ as max$\{ \text{ps}(\delta(v)) \; | \; v \in V(T) \}$. 
Then, the {\em ps-width} $\mathbf{psw}(F)$ of a formula $F$ is the minimal ps-width over all its branch decompositions.\\

\noindent
\textbf{MIM-width} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14, PHD:vatshelle}.
We once again define {\em branch decompositions}, this time for graphs in general.
A branch decomposition of a graph $G$ is a pair $(T, \delta)$ where $T$ is a rooted binary tree, and $\delta$ a bijection between the leaves of $T$ and $V(G).$
For internal nodes of $T$, $\delta$ is defined in a similar fashion as in branch decompositions of formulas.
A node $n$ analogously defines a cut of the graph, and partitions it, in accordance with $\delta(n)$, into two parts, denoted $(V_n, \overline{V_n})$.

For a graph $G$ and a subset of vertices $V \subseteq V(G)$, a {\em bigraph bipartization} is a bipartite graph $G[V, \overline{V}]$ that is a subgraph of $G$ and that only contains edges with endpoints in both $V$ and $\overline{V} = V(G) \setminus V$.

Consider $G[V_n, \overline{V_n}]$.
An independent set that is also an induced subgraph is called an {\em induced matching}.
We define {\em MIM-value} of a cut $(V_n, \overline{V_n})$ to be the size of the maximum induced matching of $G[V_n, \overline{V_n}]$.
The {\em MIM-width} of a branch decomposition is the maximum MIM-value over all cuts defined by every node.
Then, the {\em MIM-width} $\mathbf{mimw}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum MIM-width over all branch decompositions of $G$.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Hypertree-width} \cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GottlobP04}.
The {\em hypertree decomposition} of a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is defined as the triple $(T, \chi, \lambda)$ where $T$ is a tree, and $\chi, \lambda$ are labelling functions such that  $\chi : V(T) \rightarrow 2^V$ and $\lambda : V(T) \rightarrow 2^E$, where $V(T)$ is the set of vertices (nodes) of $T$.
Apart from that, the following must be fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for every hyperedge $e \in E$, there exists a $v \in V(T)$ s.t. $\{e\} \subseteq \lambda(v)$,
	\item for every vertex $v \in V$, $T[\{ n \in V(T) \; | \; v \in \chi(n) \}]$ is a connected subtree,
	\item for every node $n \in V(T)$, $\chi(n)$ only contains vertices that are incident to at least one hyperedge in $\lambda(n)$, and
	\item for every node $n \in V(T)$, if a vertex $v \in V$ is incident to a hyperedge $e \in \lambda(n)$, and if $v \in \chi(q)$ for some $q$ in a subtree below $n$, then $v\in \chi(n)$.
\end{enumerate}
Then, the {\em width} of a hypertree decomposition is $\max_{n \in V(T)} |\lambda(n)|$, and the {\em hypertree-width} $\mathbf{htw}(H)$ of a hypergraph $H$ is the minimum width over all its hypertree decompositions. \\

\textbf{Width parameters for propositional formulas}.
It's possible to introduce structural restrictions on formulas by restricting their graphical representations using the width parameters.
Usually, we are interested in such classes of formulas where the graphical representation is of some bounded width.

For some propositional formula we say that it is of width $k$ if some its graphical representation has width $k$.
We also usually mention which representation is used for determining the width parameter. As such, we refer to {\em primal treewidth}, {\em signed incidence clique-width}, and so on.

Many efficient \#SAT algorithms have been developed for specific classes of formulas with bounded width parameters.
For an overview, refer to Table \ref{table:complexity}.

\subsection{Hierarchy}

Before proceeding to algorithms for \#SAT, we provide a review of the relationships between the width parameters.
Recall that $\mathbf{tw}$, $\mathbf{tww}$, $\mathbf{cw}$, $\mathbf{bw}$, $\mathbf{rw}$, $\mathbf{psw}$, $\mathbf{mimw}$, $\mathbf{htw}$ denote treewidth, twin-width, clique-width, branch-width, rank-width, ps-width, MIM-width, and hypertree-width, respectively.
The following results have been established:
\begin{itemize}[--]
	\item $\mathbf{tww}(G) \leq 2\cdot \mathbf{cw}(G)$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/GanianPSSS22},
	\item $\mathbf{cw}(G) \leq 2^{\mathbf{tw}(G)+1}+1$ \cite{DBLP:journals/dam/FischerMR08},
	\item $\mathbf{rw}(G) \leq \mathbf{cw}(G) \leq 2^{\mathbf{rw}(G)+1}-1$ \cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/GanianHO13},
	\item $\mathbf{bw}(G) \leq \mathbf{tw}(G) + 1 \leq \lfloor \frac{3}{2} \, \mathbf{bw}(G) \rfloor$ \cite{DBLP:journals/jct/RobertsonS91},
	\item $\mathbf{rw}(G) \leq \mathbf{bw}(G)$ \cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/GanianHO13},
	\item $\mathbf{mimw}(G) \leq \mathbf{cw}(G)$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14},
	\item $\mathbf{psw}(F) \leq m^{\textbf{mimw}(G_F)}$, for a CNF formula $F$ with $m$ clauses and with incidence graph $G_F$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14},
	\item $\mathbf{htw}(H) \leq \mathbf{cw}(G_H)$, for a hypergraph $H$ with incidence graph $G_H$ \cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/GottlobP04}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Let \textbf{a} and \textbf{b} be two width parameters.
If there exist computable functions $f,g$ such that $\mathbf{a}(G) \leq f(\mathbf{b}(g(G)))$ for all $G$, parameter \textbf{a} is said to {\em dominate} parameter \textbf{b}å.
Otherwise the two parameters are said to be {\em incomparable}.
With the results above, we establish the domination hierarchy in Fig. \ref{fig:hierarchy}.

\begin{figure}

\section{Graphs of polynomial width}

In this section, we review classes of graphs of bounded width.
In particular, we are interested in such cases where the width parameters are exponentially smaller than theoretically possible, as this would allow to solve \#SAT even more efficiently.

% trees
We begin with a fairly obvious observation:

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 1.}
	If $G$ is a tree, then \textbf{tw}$(G) = 1$. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
This follows from the definition of treewidth, as any tree can be decomposed into bags of size at most 2.
As there are many ways to construct a graph representation of a CNF formula, we will quickly glance over what effects the restriction of being a tree would have for the corresponding formulas.

Recall that in primal graphs, the vertices are the variables, and the edges connect variables that appear together in a clause.
In a primal tree, each clause of the corresponding formula can be mapped to an edge in the tree.
As such, each clause contains exactly two variables.
Sibling variables (variables corresponding to sibling nodes) never appear together in a clause.

Dual trees correspond to formulas whose clauses are of unbounded size, and two clauses can share any amount of variables. However, for any three clauses it holds $C_1 \cap C_2 \cap C_3 = \emptyset$, as otherwise there would be a cycle.

An incidence graph that is also a tree has the following property: any two vertices at the same depth are either all variables or all clauses, where depth is the distance from some designated root node.
Every clause has exactly $n+1$ variables, where $n$ is the amount of the corresponding node's children.

% series-parallel
Another useful class of graphs of constant treewidth are {\em series-parallel graphs}. The following definitions are inspired by \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2004-00547}.

A {\em 2-terminal graph} $(G, s, t)$ is a graph $G$ with two designated nodes $s, t$, often called {\em terminals}.
Two 2-terminal graphs $(G_1, s_1, t_1)$, $(G_2, s_2, t_2)$ can be composed as follows:
series-composition results in a 2-terminal graph $(G, s_1, t_2)$, by a disjoint union of the two graphs and then contracting $t_1, s_2$ into one vertex;
and parallel-composition yields a 2-terminal graph $(G, s, t)$, by a disjoint union of the two graphs and contracting $s_1, s_2$ and $t_1, t_2$ into one vertex each, named $s$ and $t$ respectively.

A 2-terminal graph $(G, s, t)$ is {\em series-parallel} if it is either a two-vertex graph with a single edge,
or it results from a sequence of series- or parallel-compositions of two 2-terminal graphs.
A series-parallel graph is a graph $G$ such that there exist terminals $s, t$ where $(G, s, t)$ is a series-parallel 2-terminal graph.

The following result applies:

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 2}
	\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2004-00547}. If $G$ is a series-parallel graph, then \textbf{tw}$(G) = 2$. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
We consider graphs of formulas that are isomorphic to series-parallel graphs, i.e. there exists a bijection $\iota : V(G_F) \rightarrow V(G_{\text{sp}})$, where $G_F$ is some graph representation of the formula, and $G_{\text{sp}}$ is a series-parallel graph.

% cliques
For complete graphs (cliques), the following holds:
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 3} \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Bonnet0TW20, DBLP:journals/dam/FischerMR08}.
	If $G$ is an $n$-clique, then $\mathbf{tw}(G) = n - 1$, $\mathbf{tww}(G) = 0$, and $\mathbf{cw}(G) = 2$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The result for treewidth is obvious, since decomposition is only possible into one bag of size $n$.

Primal cliques represent formulas that consist of one clause, and the formula contains $n$ variables if its primal graph is an $n$-clique.
If the dual graph is a clique, it represents the fact that there is a non-empty set of variables that appears in every clause.
For incidence graphs this case is not of much interest, as any $n$-clique for $n > 2$ has a cycle of odd length, which rules out the clique being bipartite; a 2-clique represents a simple formula of one clause containing one variable.

% grids
The following holds for 1-dimensional grids (paths):
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 4} \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Bonnet0TW20}.
	If $G$ is a path with $n$ vertices, then $\mathbf{tw}(G)=1$, and $\mathbf{tww}(G) = 3$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
A primal path represents a formula where every clause has exactly two variables, and there are as many clauses as there are edges in the path.
Any variable appears in the formula exactly two times in different clauses.
A formula represented by a dual path contains clauses that share a set of variables with the adjacent clauses, and for any three clauses it holds that $C_1 \cap C_2 \cap C_3 = \emptyset$.
An incidence path's vertices alternate between variables and clauses, and the represented class of formulas is the same as in primal paths case.
It is easy to see that a primal path can be transformed into an incidence path by inserting clause vertices, and an incidence path into a primal path by removing said clause vertices.

The following result is for usual, 2-dimensional grids:
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 5} \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Bonnet0TW20, PHD:vatshelle}.
	If $G$ is an $n \times n$ grid, then $\mathbf{tw}(G) = n$, $\mathbf{tww}(G) = 6$, $\mathbf{cw}(G) = n + 1$, $\mathbf{rw}(G) = n - 1$, and $ \frac{1}{3}n \leq \mathbf{mimw}(G) \leq \frac{1}{2} (n+1)$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
Primal and dual grids tend to represent formulas with many clauses due to their density.
Incidence graphs can also happen to be grids, if the variables and clauses are arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

% interval graphs
An {\em interval graph} is a graph whose intersection model is that of intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14}.
That is, for some set of intervals, the graph's vertices represent these intervals, and two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding intervals intersect.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 6} \cite{PHD:vatshelle}.
	If $G$ is an interval graph with $n$ vertices, then $\mathbf{tw}(G) = n - 1$, $\mathbf{mimw}(G) = 1$, and $\mathbf{cw}(G)$ and $\mathbf{rw}(G)$ are both in $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
An {\em interval ordering} of a CNF formula is a linear ordering $\leq $ on variables and clauses of the formula, such that for any variable $x$ and clause $C$: if $x \in C$, then for all variables $y$ s.t. $x \leq y \leq C$ it follows that $y \in C$; and if $C \leq x$, then for all clauses $S$ s.t. $C \leq S \leq x$ it follows that $x \in S$ \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14}.
A CNF formula has an interval ordering iff its incidence graph is an interval graph \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14}.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 7} \cite{DBLP:conf/sat/SaetherTV14}.
	Let $F$ be a CNF formula with $m$ clauses and incidence graph $G_F$.
	If $G_F$ is an interval graph, then $\mathbf{psw}(F) \leq m$.
\end{quote}

\noindent
As an example, the formula $F=\{ \{x_1, x_2\}, \{\neg x_2, x_3\} \}$ has an interval ordering $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq C_1 \leq C_2 \leq x_3$, and its incidence graph is an interval graph.

% d-degenerate
A graph is said to be {\em $d$-degenerate} if there exists a linear ordering $\leq$ of vertices such that for any vertex $v$, the amount of neighbors $u$ s.t. $v \leq u$ is at most $d$ \cite{PHD:vatshelle}.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Fact 8} \cite{PHD:vatshelle}. If $G$ is a $d$-degenerate graph with $n$ vertices, then $\mathbf{tw}(G) \leq n - \alpha$, $\mathbf{cw}(G) \leq \frac{2n}{3} - 2\beta - 1$, $\mathbf{rw}(G) \leq \frac{n}{3} - \beta$ and $\mathbf{mimw}(G) \leq \frac{n}{3} - \beta$, where $\alpha = \frac{n}{d + 3} - 2$ and $\beta = \frac{n}{9d+3} - 1$.
